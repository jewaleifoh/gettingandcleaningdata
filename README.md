This repository includes the run_analysis.R script which:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Generates a tidy_data.txt file that can be found in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

Note:
The script must be placed in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and run.
